## A Jade 4.2.0 HTML5 Boilerplate implementation

### What is this?

As the title says. This is a Jade port of HTML5 Boilerplate 4.2.0, I wrote it simply because I couldn't find the latest boilerplate version ported. And because I was bored, actually, mostly because I was bored. I even bothered to port /404.html, for your (potential) enjoyment!
